His work integrates physical therapy, basic science and engineering principles through the use of experimental and computational modeling methods to better understand how changes in muscle properties following injury or disease affect physical function. The goal of this work is to develop new technologies and interventions that significantly improve patient care and outcomes.One focus of his work seeks to understand how skeletal muscle adapts following peripheral or central nervous system injuries and how combined muscle and nervous system changes affect upper limb function. Another focus of his work strives to understand the time course and causes of skeletal muscle wasting due to cancer driven cachexia and its effect on function and morbidity.His work has been funded by the NIH, Hartwell Foundation, Foundation for Physical Therapy Research, American Heart Association, The Brinson Foundation and Shirley Ryan AbilityLab Catalyst Fund.View Research Profile

The first area is the study of factors that influence health disparities, including access to and utilization of mental health services by Latino and other under-served and marginalized communities. Second is the development, implementation and evaluation of culturally based programming for youth. She studied the reciprocating influence of individual, family and social factors on the physical, mental and environmental health of Mexican immigrants in their sending community in Mexico and host community in the U.S. In addition, she has examined how Mexicans and Mexican Americans conceptualize depression, anxiety, phobias and nervios. Other areas of research include examining acculturative stress among Latino mothers and Latinos' perceptions of substance abuse, psychiatric co-morbidity and help-seeking. Her applied research has focused on working with the community to identify the needs of minority, under-served and marginalized communities followed by the development and evaluation of programs, including the Latino Achievement Mentoring Program (LAMP) and support services for youth and their families. The focus in this work is to create culturally competent models of programming and mental health services for the diverse needs of people from these populations and to increase retention and efficacy rates and efficacy when people do access mental health services.SpecializationMarriage and Family Therapy; Integrated Primary Care/Behavioral Health Services; Women’s Studies

She is currently serving a second term as a member of the Board of Directors of the United Cerebral Palsy Association of Philadelphia and Vicinity and is co-Chair of the Special Needs Committee of the Jewish Family & Children's Service of Southern New Jersey.Research InterestsDr. Orlin's overarching research goal is to study activity and participation for children with cerebral palsy with a concentration on the biomechanics of physical activities, such as walking and running. Her background and dissertation research have been on gait analysis and foot biomechanics in children with and without cerebral palsy.Dr. Orlin was a co-investigator on a large multicenter study of the determinants of activity and participation in children and youth with cerebral palsy. She merged that experience and her previous work in movement biomechanics, resulting in a 3-year funded study on the biomechanics of running in children with cerebral palsy, which recently ended. The biomechanical data generated by this study will help begin to answer questions as to how children with cerebral palsy run and what characteristics may be present that could potential cause stress and/or injury to the musculoskeletal system over time.Dr. Orlin is also interested in how older adolescents and young adults with developmental disabilities transition to adulthood.  She has particular concerns for skills that are transferable to sustainable employment. She has been involved in this area of interest in the local community as a community volunteer.
